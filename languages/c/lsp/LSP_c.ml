 * coupling: the HoverInfo struct is defined in:

 * The text is rendered by HoverInfo::present() / presentDefault() in:
 *   https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang-tools-extra/clangd/Hover.cpp
 * presentDefault() formats: "Type: TYPE" (variables), "→ TYPE" (functions).
 *
 * clangd hover format (MarkupKind = plaintext, not markdown fences):
 *
 * For variables like 'int x = 42':
 *   "variable x\n\nType: int\nValue = 42 (0x2a)\n\n// In main\nint x = 42"
 *   We extract: "int"  (from the "Type: " line)
 *
 * For functions like 'int add(int a, int b)':
 *   "function add\n\n→ int\nParameters:\n- int a\n- int b\n..."
 *   We extract: "int"  (from the "→ " line = return type)
 *
 * For macros or other symbols without type info:
 *   "macro FOO\n\n#define FOO 42"
 *   We return: the first line as fallback
